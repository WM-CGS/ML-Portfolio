## Types of ML
#### There are many different types of Machine Learning someone can use here are some examples
### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm that focuses on training agents to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over time. By employing trial-and-error strategies, these agents learn optimal actions through exploration and exploitation, enabling them to tackle complex tasks such as game playing and robotic control.

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a foundational machine learning approach where a model is trained on a labeled dataset, learning to map input data to corresponding output labels through patterns and relationships. By generalizing from the provided examples, the model can then make accurate predictions or classifications on new, unseen data, making it suitable for tasks like image recognition and language translation.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a versatile machine learning technique centered on analyzing unlabeled data, seeking to uncover inherent patterns, structures, or relationships within the information. Without predefined output labels, algorithms in unsupervised learning can cluster similar data points together or reduce the data's dimensionality, aiding in tasks such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and feature extraction.
