# Reinforcement Learning
### Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm that focuses on training agents to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over time. By employing trial-and-error strategies, these agents learn optimal actions through exploration and exploitation, enabling them to tackle complex tasks such as game playing and robotic control.

## CartPole v1 Using Open AI Gym
##### This Progran works by incorperating OpenAIGym to teach an algorhythm how to balence a pole. Firstly you import the libraries, these being gym(OpenAIGym),Numpy as np and time. Afterwards you set up the Cart Pole v1 enviroment, from here we can run the Simulation. There are 4 states that we need to be aware of, x Position of the cart, ẋ Velocity of the cart, θ Pole angle, θ Angular Velocity. From here we Start setting some of the limits, then rewards, max steps, and lastly Start Simulation.
