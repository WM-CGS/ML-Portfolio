# Unsupervised Learning
### Unsupervised learning is a versatile machine learning technique centered on analyzing unlabeled data, seeking to uncover inherent patterns, structures, or relationships within the information. Without predefined output labels, algorithms in unsupervised learning can cluster similar data points together or reduce the data's dimensionality, aiding in tasks such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and feature extraction.

## KMeans
### This Program works by using the Unsupervised Learning Method which excells at identifying patterns, relationships and structures within data. What KMeans aims to do is the following, "K-Means aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned centroids within a cluster." (ComputerPhile,2017). Firstly, we import the libaries numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn. Afterwards we set up the graph and download the "iris" dataset found here, from here we start building the model and outputs. After this and some last pieces of code we can retrieve the dataset.
