# Supervised Learning
### Supervised learning is a foundational machine learning approach where a model is trained on a labeled dataset, learning to map input data to corresponding output labels through patterns and relationships. By generalizing from the provided examples, the model can then make accurate predictions or classifications on new, unseen data, making it suitable for tasks like image recognition and language translation.

## K-NearestNeighbor (K-NN)
### K-NearestNeighbor (K-NN for short) is a Supervised Learning Algorythm that excells at Handling Noisy data, Non Linear data, etc. We start of my Importing the Libaries Pandas, Numpy, and Sklearn. Aftwards we show the head of the data to get a better understanding of the data we are dealing with. From there we transfer the data from non-numerical to numerical data so SKleanr can quantify the data. After this we set up our x and y train and test datasets. Now we set the hyper parameter (making sure to be careful with the number we pick). Now all thats left is to Fit and Show the data.


## Linear Regression
### Linear Regression is a Supervised Learning Algorythm that excells at Handling Large Data sets, its ability to handle missing data, can represent global data better, etc. Firstly we Import the follwing libaries, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib.pyplot, and pickle. From here we show the data to see what are working with, from here selecting the data that we want to graph. Afterwards we select the Data set we want ot predict, and set up the x and y train and test datasets. Now we save the model with pickle, and then get the predictions. From here we plot the predictions, Showing the correlation between the datasets, "G2" and "G3" or Final Grade.
